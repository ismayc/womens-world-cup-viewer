// The single source of this edition's identity, vocabulary, and display rules.
//
// Everything a component or util would otherwise hardcode inline lives here: the ESPN
// paths, the storage prefix, the match length, the .ics identity, the deploy host, the
// locale. The pattern comes from the-nfl-schedule; this is the sixth repo in the family
// to get it, and the first tournament viewer.
//
// Two rules this file is written to:
//
//   1. Every field below has a real consumer in src/. A field only a config reader
//      touches is a shallow module pretending to be a seam, and the NFL original grew
//      seven of them. The exceptions are marked: `title` and `themeColor` are consumed
//      by test/chrome-identity.test.js, because index.html and the manifest are static
//      files no module can import, and a test is the only thing that can hold them to
//      this file.
//
//   2. Structure stays out, and here that matters more than anywhere else in the
//      family. ADVANCING_PER_GROUP, ENTRY_ROUND, GROUP_MATCH_COUNT, the tie-break chain
//      and the slot grammar stay in utils/qualification.js, utils/slots.js and
//      utils/clinch.js. Those are RULES: this edition ranks on overall goal difference
//      BEFORE head-to-head, the inverse of the men's tournament, and that is a
//      different algorithm rather than a different constant. A config that tried to
//      hold it would be describing behavior, which is what stalled
//      sports-viewer-meta/adapters/.
//
// The file is named `league.js` across the whole family, including here where "league"
// is not the right noun. The convention is worth more than the precision: a maintainer
// moving between repos finds the same file at the same path. This is an EDITION, and it
// has finished; `season` and the year inside the .ics identity say which one.
