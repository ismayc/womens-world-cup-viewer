// EXACT "is this team still mathematically alive?" check — the companion to the
// Outlook's probability view, which deliberately can't answer this.
//
// The Outlook enumerates each remaining game's goal difference only up to a
// moderate cap (±8), because a huge cap would dilute every share with
// unrealistic blow-outs. A team whose only surviving path needs a bigger swing
// than that tallies 0% and vanishes from the Outlook even though it is NOT
// eliminated. This module answers the elimination question objectively instead
// of by proportion: it enumerates each group's remaining SCORELINES up to a
// generous cap — the same exact engine clinch.js uses — and applies the FULL
// FIFA tie-breaker order, so the verdict is exact rather than a
// sound-but-loose bound.
//
// The 2023 format keeps this cheap AND local: only the top two of each group
// advance and there is no best-third race, so a team's fate depends on its own
// group alone. (The Euro sibling has to reason across all six groups here.)
// Early in the stage a group may exceed the budget, in which case we stay silent
// for it — conservative, never a false elimination.
