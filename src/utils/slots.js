// How to read a knockout match's ORIGINAL bracket slot labels, and which round
// the group stage feeds into.
//
// A match record carries its slot labels in one of two ways, and every engine
// that reasons about the bracket needs the same answer from both:
//
//   • Before it is played, `t1`/`t2` ARE the labels ("Winner Group A"), exactly
//     as the fixture list was drawn. This is how a live edition arrives.
//   • Once it is played, `t1`/`t2` hold the real teams and the labels move to
//     `label1`/`label2`, so a finished edition still knows the provenance of
//     each slot — which is what lets the bracket say "Winner Group C" under
//     Uruguay, and what the projection engines parse.
//
// Reading `t1` directly would therefore work only for an unplayed tournament,
// and would silently stop matching the moment a result landed.

import { TEAMS } from '../data/teams.js'

// The knockout round the group stage feeds into. This 32-team format takes only
// the top TWO of each of the EIGHT groups — sixteen teams, so the groups feed a
// ROUND OF 16. There is no best-third qualification; a group's 3rd and 4th are
// simply out, which is what makes every qualification question answerable inside
// a single group (the 2015-2023 Women's World Cups used 24 teams and four best
// thirds; 2023's expansion to 32 removed that whole layer).
export const ENTRY_ROUND = 'R16'

// Group letters actually in use, as a regex character class — so a stray label
// naming a group this edition doesn't have fails to parse instead of resolving
// to nothing halfway through.
