// Knockout-opponent clinch detection.
//
// "Has team X clinched a specific round-of-16 opponent?" is more than "has X
// advanced" — it asks whether the opponent is the SAME team in every remaining
// completion of the group stage. Being conservative (only certain once all
// groups finish) under-claims: a matchup can be mathematically locked while
// other groups are still playing — a Winner A v Runner-up B tie locks the moment
// Groups A and B are settled, whatever Groups C and D do.
//
// The 2023 format makes this a two-group question and nothing more. Every
// round-of-16 slot is a group winner or a group runner-up (there is no
// best-third slot whose group depends on a cross-group race), so a team is
// handled here once its own finishing slot is fixed, and its opponent is locked
// exactly when the OTHER group's corresponding slot is itself clinched.
