// EXACT round-of-16 outlook by full enumeration of remaining GOAL DIFFERENCES.
//
// Walking only win/draw/loss (a single one-goal scoreline per game) collapses
// goal difference — and under FIFA's 2023 tie-breakers goal difference is the
// FIRST thing that separates teams level on points, so a W/D/L walk couldn't
// tell whether a second-placed team finishes above or below a rival. We
// therefore enumerate each remaining game's MARGIN over an adaptive range
// (±cap), so the tie-breakers resolve with real proportions.
//
// Tractability: enumerating every margin combination directly is (2·cap+1)^games
// (e.g. 17^8 ≈ 7 billion). Instead we decompose per group — each group's
// remaining games are enumerated locally, and the many margin combinations that
// yield the SAME (winner, runner-up) pair are collapsed into one weighted
// outcome. The cross-group step then iterates the cartesian product of those
// DISTINCT per-group outcomes (small, since only two names matter per group),
// accumulating the product of weights. The reported percentage for a slot is
// weighted-count / total, where total = Π (2·cap+1)^(remaining games in group) —
// i.e. every margin combination counts equally (a combinatorial proportion, NOT
// a forecast).
//
// The collapse is much coarser here than in the Euro sibling, and that is the
// format's doing: with no best-third race, nothing outside (winner, runner-up)
// can affect a round-of-16 slot, so a group's third-place profile — which the
// Euro must carry through the whole cartesian — is simply irrelevant.
//
// Conventions:
//  • Goals are taken to equal the margin (win by k → k–0, draw → 0–0). Goal
//    DIFFERENCE is therefore exact; goals-SCORED (the next tie-breaker) follows
//    this convention — a small residual approximation only when teams are level
//    on points AND goal difference.
//  • cap is adaptive: large enough to cover any tie-breaker-relevant margin
//    (≥8, like the clinch engine), but lowered automatically if the distinct-
//    outcome cartesian would be too large to walk.
