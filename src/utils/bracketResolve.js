// Resolve knockout-bracket placeholders into real teams as the tournament
// progresses — completing what clinch.js starts for the group slots:
//   • "Winner Match N" / "Loser Match N" slots fill from each knockout result
//     (penalties break a draw), propagating up the bracket round by round. The
//     LOSER form matters here in a way it doesn't at the Euro: the Women's World
//     Cup still plays a third-place play-off, whose two slots are the losing
//     semi-finalists.
//
// All resolution is conservative: a slot stays a placeholder until its outcome
// is genuinely settled, so the bracket never shows a team that could still
// change. The Standings "as it stands" panel is where provisional projections
// live.
//
// The Euro sibling also has to fill "3rd Group X/Y/Z" slots from a cross-group
// best-thirds race. The Women's World Cup advances only the top two of each group, so
// group-slot resolution is entirely clinch.js's job and nothing is left over.
